# Example 1 
x = 5
print(x > 3 and x < 10) # True because both condition are true

# Example 2
y = 12
print(y > 10 and y % 5 == 0 ) # False because the second condition is False

# Example 3
x = 5 
print(x < 3 or x > 10) #False because both conditions are false

# Example 2 
y = 12
print(y < 10 or y % 2 == 0) # True because the csecond condition  is True

# Example 1 
x = 5
print(not(x > 3 and x < 10)) # False because the condtion inside the not is true

#Example 2
y = 12
print(not( y > 10 and y % 5 == 0)) # True because the condition inside the not is false
